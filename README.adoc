= Spring Cloud Contract RAML

WARNING: RAML support is experimental and prone to changes in the future. Also it requires
 certain conditions on the RAML contract to make the conversion work properly

Spring Cloud Contract comes with an experimental out of the box support for https://raml.org/[RAML] representation of contracts.
In other words instead of using the Groovy DSL you can use Pact files. In this section
we will present how to add such a support for your project.

== RAML constraints

The biggest challenge in making RAML become an input for Spring Cloud Contract is that RAML is
an extended representation of a schema. It allows you to group a few request examples together
with some response examples. Spring Cloud Contract doesn't want to bind to a schema thus it
focuses on presenting a pair of request response examples. That's why not every RAML
file is possible to be converted into a Spring Cloud Contract example. Of course with time
and feedback from the users we will try to minimize the number of constraints.

For the RAML contract be considered proper as input for Spring Cloud Contract it has to
pass the following tests:

- It has to use RAML version 1.0
- The *baseUri* if present has to contain only the host and no additional path (e.g. *http://localhost:8081* is ok, whereas *http://localhost:8081/api/2.5* is not)
- Every request that has a body has to have an *example* of a body
- Every request that has headers has to have *default values* for these headers
- Every request that has query parameters has to have *default values* for these parameters
- Every response that has a body has to have an *example* of a body
- Every response that has headers has to have *default values* for these headers

If you have multiple examples of of bodies only the first one will be taken into consideration.
The best solution is to have a single pair of request / response in a single RAML file.

== RAML example

We will be working on the following example of a RAML contract. We've placed this file under
the `src/test/resources/contracts` folder.

== RAML for producers

On the producer side you have add to your project dependencies a couple of dependencies.
The Spring Cloud Contract RAML support and RAML related dependencies to your Spring Cloud Contract
Maven plugin / Gradle buildscript classpath:

== RAML for consumers

On the producer side you need to add the following dependencies to your test compile
classpath.
